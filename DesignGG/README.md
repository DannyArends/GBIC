DesignGG: Optimize your Genetical Genomics Experiment
=====================================================
Understanding the functioning of biological systems is a major challenge 
in light of the complex interplay of genes and environment.
Combining biomolecular profiling of genetic divergent individuals under 
one or more different environmental conditions can provide the data for 
unraveling this puzzle, a strategy known as genetical genomics.

Here we present an R package and web tool to optimally design such genetical genomics experiments.

Dependencies
------------
R 2.10.0 or higher with the R package 'affy' and 'nlme' installed.

Installation
------------
Download the provided .zip R package (Be carefull not to download the source) for windows 32/64 bit, or 
the tar.gz for other operating systems.
On the commandline use: R CMD INSTALL affyGG_X.X-X.zip or R CMD INSTALL affyGG_X.X-X.tar.gz
