Description: MetaNetwork maps metabolite quantitative trait loci
        (mQTLs) underlying variation in metabolite abundance in
        individuals of a segregating population with a two-part model
        to account for the often observed spike in the distribution of
        metabolite data. MetaNetwork predicts and visualizes potential
        associations between metabolites using correlations of mQTL
        profiles, rather than of abundance profiles. Simulation and
        permutation procedures are used to assess statistical
        significance.
